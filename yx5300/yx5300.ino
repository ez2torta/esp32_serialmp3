/*

  --- Basic playback of track ---
  
  Establishes connection with the YX5300 MP3 Module and plays the first 
  track on the device, looping through every song on the SD card.
  
  The circuit:
  - MP3 module TX connected to pin 16 (RX1)
  - MP3 module RX connected to pin 17 (TX1)
  
  Other notes:
  1. The SD card must have at least one song for playback. 
  Consider using the example music provided on GitHub:
